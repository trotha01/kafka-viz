What is Kafka (pronounce Kyafkuh)?
===

[Kafka](http://kafka.apache.org/) is designed to allow a single cluster to serve as the central data backbone for a large organization. It can be elastically and transparently expanded without downtime. Data streams are partitioned and spread over a cluster of machines to allow data streams larger than the capability of any single machine and to allow clusters of co-ordinated consumers
